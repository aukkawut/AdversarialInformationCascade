# Adversarial Information Cascade
This is the repository for my final project in OIE 559 Advanced Prescriptive Analytics at WPI. The work here is about the competitive cascading behavior of the 2 informations within the networks. The goal here is to maximize the expected edge spreading.

# Why not normal information cascade?

Consider the case where you want to talk about the politics. Let say there are two parties: A and B. A supporters can share the information of A to further support A or share the information of B to criticize them. Thus, looking at the node itself might not reflecting the behavior of the network.

# How is this network being generated?

The network is generated from Erdős–Rényi model.
